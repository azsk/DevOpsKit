    "ControlSeverity": "High",
    "Automated": "Yes",
    "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
    "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

    "ControlSeverity": "High",
    "Automated": "Yes",
    "MethodName": "CheckCredInVariables",
    "Rationale": "Keeping secrets such as connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise. Making them secret type variables ensures that they are protected at rest.",

      "Rationale": "Keeping secret files such as signing certificates, Apple Provisioning Profiles, Android KeyStore files, SSH keys etc. in repository can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle.

    "Rationale": "Each additional build having access at repositories increases the attack surface. To minimize this risk ensure that only activite and legitimate build resources present in Organization",
    "Recommendation": "To remove inactive build pipelines follow the steps given here: 1.Navigate to the build pipeline. 2. Select a build pipeline. 3. Select three dots (present in right top). 4. Click on Delete. (https://www.azuredevopslabs.com/labs/devopsserver/build/)",

    "MethodName": "CheckInheritPermissions",
    "Rationale": "Disabling inherit permissions lets you finely control access to various operations at the build level for different stakeholders. This ensures that you follow the principle of least privilege and provide access only to the persons that require it.",
    "Recommendation": "To disable inheritance follow the steps given here: 1.Navigate to the build pipeline. 2. Open up the Security dialog for the build. 3. Add the service lead & service owner as Users with Allow permissions for each permission line item. 4. Select “Off” under Inheritance. 5. Add users/groups to your build definition and provide only required access. As best practice, All teams/groups must be granted minimum required permissions on build definition.",

    "MethodName": "CheckSettableAtQueueTime",
    "Rationale": "Pipeline variables not marked settable at queue time can only be changed by someone with elevated permissions. These variables (reasonably) used in ways that make code injection possible.",

    "MethodName": "ExternalSourceSelfHostedBuild",
    "Rationale": "Builds execute attacker-controlled code by-design (e.g. solution files contain build command lines to invoke, unit tests compile into DLLs that are loaded and executed by a harness, etc). Building code from untrusted external sources is effectively allowing external parties to execute arbitrary code on your computer.",
