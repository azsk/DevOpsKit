      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove any excessive privileges granted on the CDN. Run command Remove-AzRoleAssignment -SignInName '{signInName}' -Scope '{scope}' -RoleDefinitionName '{role definition name}'. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzRoleAssignment -full' for more help.",

      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Using token authentication prevents Azure CDN from serving assets to unauthorized clients. This keeps other sites from 'hotlinking' content and using your assets without permission",
      "Recommendation": "To enable token authentication (currently available on Premium Verizon tier), go to Azure Portal --> your CDN Profile --> Manage --> HTTP LARGE --> Token Auth. Please refer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-token-auth for more details on token authentication.",

      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Keeping secrets such as DB connection strings, passwords, keys, etc. in clear text can lead to easy compromise at various avenues during an application's lifecycle. Storing them in a key vault ensures that they are protected at rest.",
      "Recommendation": "Refer https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/documentation/articles/key-vault-get-started/ (Key Vault) and  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-token-auth (token-based authentication in CDN).",

      "MethodName": "CheckCDNHttpsProtocol",
      "Rationale": "Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "To enable HTTPS protocol: Go to Azure Portal --> your CDN Profile --> your CDN Endpoint --> Origin --> Select HTTPS --> Save. Else implement through PowerShell as follows: `$ce= Get-AzCdnEndpoint -EndpointName <EndpointName> -ProfileName <CDNprofile> -ResourceGroupName <RGName>; `$ce.IsHttpAllowed =`$false; `$ce.IsHttpsAllowed =`$true; Set-AzCdnEndpoint -CdnEndpoint `$ce",
