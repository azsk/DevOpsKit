        "Rationale": "The Admin user account is designed for a single user to access the registry. Multiple users authenticating with the admin account appear as just one user to the registry. This leads to loss of auditability. Using AAD-based identity ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.",
        "Recommendation": "Run command 'Update-AzureRmContainerRegistry -DisableAdminUser -Name '<ContainerRegistryName>' -ResourceGroupName '<RGName>'. Run 'Get-Help Update-AzureRmContainerRegistry -full' for more help. You can add AAD-based SPNs or user accounts to the appropriate RBAC role instead.",

        "Automated": "Yes",
        "MethodName": "CheckResourceAccess",
        "Rationale": "Using a 'user' account should be avoided because, in general, a user account will likely have broader set of privileges to enterprise assets. Using a dedicated SPN ensures that the SPN does not have permissions beyond the ones specifically granted for the given scenario.",
