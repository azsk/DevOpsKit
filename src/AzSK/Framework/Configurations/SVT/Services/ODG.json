      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "The ODG machine is serving as a 'gateway' into the corporate environment allowing endpoint in the cloud access to enteprise data. Using a locked-down, secure baseline configuration ensures that this machine does not get leveraged as an entry point to the downstream data server/service.",
      "Recommendation": "Locking down machine isolates ODG tool and prevents malfunctioning programs from damaging or snooping on the data source machine. ",

      "Recommendation": "With privacy level settings, user can specify an isolation level that defines the degree that one data source must be isolated from other data sources.
