      "ControlSeverity": "High",

      "MethodName": "CheckMySQLFirewallAccessAzureService",
      "Rationale": "The 'Allow access to Azure services' setting configures a very broad range of IP addresses from Azure as permitted to access the MySQL Server. Please make sure your scenario really requires this setting before enabling it. Turning it ON exposes your MySQL Server to risk of attacks from resources (IPs) owned by others in the Azure region.",
      "Recommendation": "1. Turn 'OFF' the 'Allow access to Azure services' setting. 2. Remove IP range from firewall rules. Refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-firewall-rules#connecting-from-azure",

    "Rationale": "Using the firewall feature ensures that access to the data or the service is restricted to a specific set/group of clients. NOTE: While this control does provide an extra layer of access control protection, it may not always be feasible to implement in all scenarios.",
