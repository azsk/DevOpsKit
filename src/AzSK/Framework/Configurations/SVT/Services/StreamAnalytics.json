      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove any excessive privileges granted on the Stream Analytics. Assign 'Log Analytics Contributor' RBAC role to developers who manages Stream Analytics configurations. Run command: Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -SignInName '{signInName}' -Scope '{scope}' -RoleDefinitionName '{role definition name}'. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -full' for more help.

      "Rationale": "Paired namespaces help maintain consistent availability of a Stream Analytics based solution in case of an outage (e.g. throttling, storage issue, subsystem failure) in the primary region.",
      "Recommendation": "Critical jobs of Stream Analytics should be deployed to both paired regions. In addition to Stream Analytics internal monitoring capabilities, customers are also advised to monitor the jobs. If a break is identified to be a result of the Stream Analytics service update, escalate appropriately and fail over any downstream consumers to the healthy job output. Escalation to support will prevent the paired region from being affected by the new deployment and maintain the integrity of the paired jobs.
