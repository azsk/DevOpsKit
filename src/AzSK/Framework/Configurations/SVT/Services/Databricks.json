      "MethodName": "CheckKeyVaultReference",
      "Rationale": "Using a separate key vault for each secret scope leads to better segregation of access to secrets via use of scope level ACLs. If the same key vault is used for two different scopes then any person with access to either of them will be able to see keys and secrets in both. ",

      "Rationale": "If a personal access token (PAT) gets compromised, the Databricks assets accessible to the user can be accessed/manipulated by unauthorized users. Minimizing the validity period of the PAT ensures that the window of time available to an attacker in the event of compromise is small.",
