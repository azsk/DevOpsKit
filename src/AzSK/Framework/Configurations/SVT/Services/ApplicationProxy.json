        "MethodName": "",
        "Rationale": "AAD App proxy facilitates remote access to your on-prem apps. If these apps have not been designed and implemented securely, then security issues of your apps get exposed to the internet.",

        "MethodName": "",
        "Rationale": "Pre-authentication by its very nature, blocks a significant number of anonymous attacks, because only authenticated identities can access the back-end application.",
        "Recommendation": "AAD Application Administrator (or higher privilege role) can check app pre-authentication configuration from portal or by running command 'Get-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication -ObjectId <AADAppID>'. To enable AAD Auth run command 'Set-AzureADApplicationProxyApplication -ObjectId <AppObjectID> -ExternalAuthenticationType AadPreAuthentication'.
