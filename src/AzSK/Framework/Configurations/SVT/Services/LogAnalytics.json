        "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
        "Automated": "Yes",
        "MethodName": "CheckResourceRBACAccess",
        "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
        "Recommendation": "1. Configure the workspace access control mode to 'Use resource or workspace permissions'. 2. Use Table level and Resource centric RBAC model to regulate access to monitoring data and settings. Refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/manage-access 3. Review control plane access (see detailed log file)",

        "Rationale": "Granting elevated access to the Run As Account (SPN) of the Automation Account linked to your Log Analytics workspace increases the probability of exposure of the resources. This is because attacker can use this access to run custom logic on your subscription.",
        "Recommendation": "If Log Analytics workspace is linked to Automation Account, make sure you add Run as Account's SPN at the specific permission scope and role required for your scenario. For example, sometimes 'Contributor' access at 'Resource Group' scope might work. In other scenarios you may need 'Reader' access at 'Subscription' scope. Exact permission will vary based on your use case. If you want to remove the SPN, run command Remove-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId '{objectId}' -Scope '{scope}' -RoleDefinitionName '{role definition name}'.
