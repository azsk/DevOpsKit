      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Using the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control. All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (xxx.onmicrosoft.com) and users in the native directory are trusted for authentication to enterprise subscriptions.",

      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Assign only the 'Data Lake Analytics Developer' RBAC role to developers who manage U-SQL jobs. Refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-manage-use-portal#manage-users",

      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum permissions to users/security groups on data lake store file system by leveraging Access Control List (ACL) feature ensures that U-SQL jobs executed by users/security groups would perform only intended read/write operations. This minimizes exposure of the data in case of user credentials leak or faulty job programming.",

      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale":  "Setting up storage data source using PowerShell command eliminates the risk of exposing storage account key (because the key itself is not displayed on the GUI at all).",
      "Recommendation": "Setup storage data source using PowerShell command 'Add-AzureRmDataLakeAnalyticsDataSource -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroup> -Account <ADLAAccount> -AzureBlob <StorageAccount> -AccessKey ((Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -ResourceGroupName <ResourceGroupOfStorageAccount> -Name <StorageAccountName>).Key1",

      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale":  "Credentials added in form of plain text in U-SQL job have higher chances of getting compromised. The job code is also likely check in into a code repository so the credential is visible to many parties.",
      "Recommendation": "Password of the account used to access SQL Azure must be created as a new catalog secret using the 'New-AzureRmDataLakeAnalyticsCatalogSecret' PS command.

      "Rationale": "ADLA U-SQL File Import wizard does not impose any restrictions on file format nor does it scan uploaded files for security issues. If these files are at an insecure/untrustworthy location, they can be tampered/infested. This can lead to compromise of the ADLA jobs and data.",

      "MethodName": "CheckDiagnosticsSettings",
      "Rationale": "Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.",

      "Rationale": "Data Lake Analytics does not offer features to cover backup/disaster recovery out-of-the-box. As a result, when processing critical workloads, a team must have adequate backups of the data and the jobs (catalog, code, etc.).",
