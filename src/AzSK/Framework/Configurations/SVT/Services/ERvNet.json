      "MethodName": "CheckMultiNICVMUsed",
      "Rationale": "Using multiple NICs, one can route traffic between the ER-connected virtual network and another non-ER-connected virtual network. This can put the corporate network at risk. (Multi-NIC VMs on an ER-connected virtual network may be required in some advanced scenarios. You should engage the network security team for a review in such cases.)",

      "Rationale": "Using IP Forwarding one can change the routing of packets from an ER-connected virtual network. This can lead to bypass of network protections that are required and applicable for corpnet traffic. (IP Forwarding on an ER-connected virtual network may be required only in advanced scenarios such as Network Virtual Applicances. You should engage the network security team for a review in such cases.)",
