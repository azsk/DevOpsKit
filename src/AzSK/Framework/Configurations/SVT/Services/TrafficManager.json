      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Clean up any unauthorized users on the Traffic Manager Profile. Run command Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -SignInName '{signInName}' -Scope '{scope}}' -RoleDefinitionName {role definition name}'. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -full' to get the complete details about this command.",

      "Recommendation": "To enable HTTPS protocol for endpoint monitoring, go to Azure Portal --> your Traffic Manager Profile --> Configuration -->  Select HTTPS --> Save.",
