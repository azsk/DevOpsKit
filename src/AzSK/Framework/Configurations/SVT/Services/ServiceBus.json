      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckServiceBusRootPolicy",
      "Rationale": "A 'namespace' level access policy provides access to all Queues/Topics in a namespace. However, using an access policy at entity (Queue/Topic) level provides access only to the specific entity. Thus using the latter is inline with the principle of least privilege.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove all the authorization rules from Service Bus namespace except RootManageSharedAccessKey using Remove-AzureRmServiceBusAuthorizationRule command. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzureRmServiceBusAuthorizationRule -full' for more help. Use the Azure portal to configure shared access policies with appropriate claims at the specific entity (Topic/Queue) scope.",

      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckServiceBusAuthorizationRule",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes operation preformed on the resource in case of access policy key compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Access policies must have the minimum required permissions. For instance, if the client app is only reading a Topic or a Queue (as opposed to sending), then the policy used must only include the 'Listen' claim.

      "Rationale": "Periodic key/password rotation is a good security hygiene practice as, over time, it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise which can arise from key theft/brute forcing/recovery attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "Use New-AzureRmServiceBusKey -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -NamespaceName <NamespaceName> -Queue <QueueName> -RegenerateKeys PrimaryKey/SecondaryKey to regenerate Queue key. Use New-AzureRmServiceBusKey -ResourceGroup <ResourceGroupName> -NamespaceName <NamespaceName> -Topic <TopicName> -RegenerateKeys PrimaryKey/SecondaryKey to regenerate Topic key.

      "Recommendation": "In case of Service Bus outage (e.g. throttling, storage issue, single subsystem failure, Azure data center failure), messages sent by sender application will not be received by Service Bus. To maintain consistent availability of application, Service Bus users should use a paired namespace in a different data center. Paired namespace  will send the messages to secondary queue(s) while primary queue is down.

      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Administrator should assign 'Owner' role to Service Bus at the 'resource' scope. Application developers should not have direct access to the Service Bus resource (they should just be provided the required shared access policy for a non-production Topic/Queue entity). Auditors should have 'Monitor Contributor Service Role' or 'Monitor Reader Service Role' based on their role.",
