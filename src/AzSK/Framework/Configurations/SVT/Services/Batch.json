      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
      "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove any excessive privileges granted on the Batch service. Run command Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -SignInName '{signInName}' -Scope '{scope}' -RoleDefinitionName '{role definition name}'. Run 'Get-Help Remove-AzureRmRoleAssignment -full' for more help.

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "MethodName": "",
      "Rationale": "Using this feature ensures that sensitive data is stored encrypted at rest. This minimizes the risk of data loss from physical theft and also helps meet regulatory compliance requirements.",

      "Rationale": "Encrypting the sensitive data like secrets/keys minimizes the exposure until runtime. Using the uploaded certificates, compute nodes can decrypt the secrets as needed at runtime.",
      "Recommendation": "Certificates need to be installed on the compute nodes used by Batch in order to protect sensitive information. Run command New-AzureBatchCertificate  -FilePath '{FilePath}'  -BatchContext '{BatchContext}' -Password '{Password}'. Note: Password value should be a secure string variable.

      "Rationale": "Periodic key/password rotation is a good security hygiene practice as, over time, it minimizes the likelihood of data loss/compromise which can arise from key theft/brute forcing/recovery attacks.",

      "MethodName": "CheckDiagnosticsSettings",
      "Rationale": "Logs should be retained for a long enough period so that activity trail can be recreated when investigations are required in the event of an incident or a compromise. A period of 1 year is typical for several compliance requirements as well.",
