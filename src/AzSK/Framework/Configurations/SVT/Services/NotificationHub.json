(1) Steps to clean up notification hubs through Azure portal - (a) Logon to https://portal.azure.com/ (b) Navigate to the 'Notification Hubs' (c) Navigate to the notification hub that has be removed and click on the 'Delete' icon. (d) Perform this operation for all the notification hubs that has to be removed from the subscription. (2) Steps to clean up notification hub through command - Run the command 'Remove-AzureRmNotificationHub [-ResourceGroup] <String>  [-Namespace] <String> [-NotificationHub] <String> [-Confirm] [-Force] [-WhatIf] [<CommonParameters>]'",

      "Rationale": "A 'namespace' level access policy provides access to all Notification Hubs in a namespace. However, using an access policy at Notification Hub level provides access only to the specific Notification Hub. Thus using the latter is inline with the principle of least privilege.",
