      "Id": "CloudService01",
      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "No",
      "Rationale": "Using the native enterprise directory for authentication ensures that there is a built-in high level of assurance in the user identity established for subsequent access control.All Enterprise subscriptions are automatically associated with their enterprise directory (xxx.onmicrosoft.com) and users in the native directory are trusted for authentication to enterprise subscriptions.",
      "Recommendation": "Create an AAD App. Configure the App with your cloud service URLs to enforce AAD auth for every request. Refer: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2014/11/19/connecting-to-cloud-services/",

      "Id": "CloudService03",
      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "Rationale": "Use of HTTPS ensures server/service authentication and protects data in transit from network layer man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping, session-hijacking attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "Get an SSL certificate from a trusted certificate provider. Upload that certificate to cloud service. Update input endpoints by renaming HTTP to HTTPS in .csdef. Refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-services/cloud-services-configure-ssl-certificate",

      "Description": "Remove unused internal endpoints",
      "Id": "CloudService04",
      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Rationale": "Internal endpoints are available for instance-to-instance communication with in cloud service. Exploitation of one such internal instance can put all the other internal instances at risk with which it has open communication channels.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove unused internal endpoints from .csdef and redeploy your cloud service to reflect the new changes. Refer: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-enable-communication-role-instances",

      "Description": "Remove unused input endpoints",
      "Id": "CloudService05",
      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Rationale": "The input endpoint is used when you want to expose a port to the outside from a cloud service. Such unintended open connections expose cloud service instances to a high level of risk from internet-based attacks that attempt to brute force credentials to gain access to the machine.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove unused input endpoints from .csdef and redeploy your cloud service to reflect the new changes. Refer: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/cloud-services-enable-communication-role-instances",

      "Id": "CloudService06",
      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Rationale": "Remote debugging requires inbound ports to be opened. These ports become easy targets for compromise from various internet based attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "Remove [Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.RemoteDebugger*] endpoints from .csdef and redeploy your cloud service to reflect the new changes. Refer: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vs-azure-tools-debug-cloud-services-virtual-machines",

      "Id": "CloudService07",
      "ControlSeverity": "Medium",
      "Rationale": "Use of custom domain protects a web application from common attacks such as phishing, session hijacking and other DNS-related attacks.",
      "Recommendation": "Get an SSL certificate for your CNAME from a trusted certificate provider and upload the same to your cloud service.

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Rationale": "Cloud services where automatic updates are disabled are likely to miss important security patches (human error, forgetfulness). This may lead to compromise from various malware/trojan attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in operating systems and related software.",
