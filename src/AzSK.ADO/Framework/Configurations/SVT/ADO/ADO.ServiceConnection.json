      "MethodName": "CheckServiceConnectionAccess",
      "Rationale": "SPN-based logins do not have MFA protection. It is important to restrict the access granted to Azure service connections only to specific resource/resource group as needed. This can contain the extent of damage in case of compromise.",
      "Recommendation": "Make sure you add SPN at the specific permission scope and role required for your scenario. For example, sometimes 'Contributor' access at 'Resource Group' scope might work. Exact permission will vary based on your use case.

      "Rationale": "Global groups are maintained at organization and project level and may contain users at a very broad scope (e.g., all users in the organization). Granting elevated permissions to these groups can risk exposure of service connections to unwarranted individuals.",
      "Recommendation": "Refer detailed log files for the list of non compliant service connections. To remediate this follow steps given here: 1. Navigate to the project settings page 2. Select service connection under pipelines category  3. Select your service connection from the list 4. Select Roles from the menu 5. Check for a global security group - (a) global security group added as a User (b) global security group added as an Administrator 6. Remove all global security groups. 7.
