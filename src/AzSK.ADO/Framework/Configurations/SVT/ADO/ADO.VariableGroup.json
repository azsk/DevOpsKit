            "Automated": "Yes",
            "MethodName": "CheckRBACAccess",
            "Rationale": "Granting minimum access by leveraging RBAC feature ensures that users are granted just enough permissions to perform their tasks. This minimizes exposure of the resources in case of user/service account compromise.",

            "Automated": "Yes",
            "MethodName": "CheckPipelineAccess",
            "Rationale": "To support security of the pipeline operations, variable groups must not be granted access to all pipelines. This is in keeping with the principle of least privilege because a vulnerability in components used by one pipeline can be leveraged by an attacker to attack other pipelines having access to critical resources.",
            "Recommendation": "To remediate this, 1.Navigate to the variable group. 2. Disable 'Allow access to all pipelines'.",

            "MethodName": "CheckInheritedPermissions",
            "Rationale": "Disabling inherited permissions lets you finely control access to various operations at the variable group level for different stakeholders. This ensures that you follow the principle of least privilege and provide access only to the persons that require it.",
            "Recommendation": "To disable inheritance follow the steps given here: 1.Navigate to the variable group. 2. Select Security. 3. Turn off Inheritance. As best practice, all teams/groups must be granted minimum required permissions on variable group.",
