      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckOldTestDemoApps",
      "Rationale": "Demo apps are usually short-term projects that do not go through the full engineering process and due diligence required for enterprise apps. As a result, it is important to constantly review and prune demo app entries from the tenant.",

      "ControlSeverity": "High",
      "Automated": "Yes",
      "MethodName": "CheckReturnURLsAreHTTPS",
      "Rationale": "Return URLs of an application are particularly sensitive because many authentication flows involve posting the token to the returnURL after successful authentication. If such a URL does not use HTTPS, it leads to disclosure of the token on the network in clear text.",
